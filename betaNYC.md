I didn't like the Citibike app.

# :(
* Terrible symbology on the map (nearly empty? nearly full? terrible!!)
* No alerts
* No directions
* No historical/trend information
* Only what Citibank want shown (ATMs and branches? Really?)
* Can't tell whether it's refreshed


# ?
Did some searching and before I found out that Citibike has their own endpoint, I found
[Citybik.es](http://citybik.es). Figured anything I'd want to do for NYC could be useful elsewhere, so OK!

But (show the format): http://api.citybik.es/citibikenyc.json

+ Analysis on the data.

Lots of tools at my disposal if only the data were in the right format.

I could scrape and push to a static store, but why not just redirect to the live source?

So, node-geoservice-adaptor (at esri.github.io) [http://github.com/esri/node-geoservices-adaptor]

* Teach myself node.js
* Teach me about our services
* Eat own dogfoos

Then I built a [WebMap](http://geeknixta.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=960e5f0425b34765a957036e9cd38bb5) and [Template App](http://geeknixta.maps.arcgis.com/apps/OnePane/basicviewer/index.html?appid=adaf2757b3d346a09647d28574df22bd).
Wait - our platform with no extra coding etc. just displaying live Citybike data. What is this?

And that can open in our mobile Apps and SDKs/APIs.

Now can work with it, but not yet show it off.

So, before I build my killer iOS app, I'm going to just build a quick web viewer to look
at all global data.
